# Ambi_Developer_Node_Test

The problem:

Compare two files and see which words they have in common. Then see which file uses that word more.
You are given two files. Read them asynchronously and write the result out in a list. The more positive
th count for a word is, the more it appears in the first file. The more negative a word is the  more it 
appears in the second file.

I used callbacks to proccess the files asynchronously.
I tried to make functions small. Each function clearly has its own job.



To run the code simply download it and use "node index.js"
